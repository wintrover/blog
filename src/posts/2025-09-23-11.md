excerpt: "We migrated from DeepFace to InsightFace to unlock GPU-friendly batch processing, established code quality with SonarQube and SOLID, benchmarked with LFW, visualized metrics in W&B, and started React–FastAPI integration."
---

## Why the migration?
Early experiments with DeepFace hit practical limits in GPU parallelism and multi-image throughput. Moving to InsightFace helped us standardize multi-image processing on GPU, cut per-image latency, and increase throughput — making the pipeline ready for production traffic.

## Quality and Operations
- SonarQube for automated detection of bugs, code smells, and hotspots.
- SOLID refactoring across service/repository/gateway layers to stabilize dependencies and isolate responsibilities.
- Dockerized GPU runtime for consistent environments across dev/test/CI.
- CI pipeline with linting and lightweight checks on each change.

## Benchmarking and Visualization
- LFW was used for objective validation (Accuracy, AUC).
- Introduced W&B to track experiments and visualize metrics (accuracy curves, ROC/AUC) per run — making regressions visible and reproducible.

## Service Integration (React + FastAPI)
- While wiring the real service, we fixed upload bugs and type mismatches.
- Established clear contracts and defensive error paths (timeouts, invalid payloads) for stable data exchange.

## Example snippets

### 1) InsightFace: GPU-backed embeddings (single image)
```python
from insightface.app import FaceAnalysis
import cv2

app = FaceAnalysis(name='buffalo_l')
app.prepare(ctx_id=0, det_size=(640, 640))

img = cv2.imread('face.jpg')
faces = app.get(img)
embeddings = [f.normed_embedding for f in faces]
print(len(embeddings), 'embeddings computed')
```

### 2) CI pipeline: lint + build (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  web:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint || echo "lint warnings"
      - run: npm run build
```

### 3) Log LFW metrics with W&B
```python
import wandb
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score

wandb.init(project='face-benchmark', config={'dataset': 'LFW'})
# y_true, y_score prepared from verification pairs
acc = accuracy_score(y_true, (y_score > 0.5).astype(int))
auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score)
wandb.log({'lfw/accuracy': acc, 'lfw/auc': auc})
wandb.finish()
```

### 4) FastAPI endpoint + React upload
```python
# fastapi
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
app = FastAPI()

@app.post('/api/images')
async def upload_image(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    data = await file.read()
    # validate & store
    return {"ok": True, "size": len(data)}
```

```tsx
// react
async function upload(blob: Blob) {
  const fd = new FormData();
  fd.append('file', blob, 'image.jpg');
  const res = await fetch('/api/images', { method: 'POST', body: fd });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Upload failed');
}
```

## What we learned
- Measure first: LFW + W&B made improvements and regressions explicit.
- Make quality repeatable: SonarQube + SOLID + CI kept changes safe.
- Prepare for service: InsightFace GPU flow and clear contracts reduced unexpected runtime issues.

## Next
Scale out batched/stream flows, add inference caching, and iterate based on user-centric metrics to evolve the pipeline responsibly.
