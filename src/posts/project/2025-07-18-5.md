## Introduction

While working on a side project, I thought, "Why not add a Google login feature?"

_"Google login? Shouldn't it be as simple as creating a button and calling a few APIs?"_

Little did I know how much of a learning journey this thought would become. From my first encounter with the term OAuth 2.0, I learned so much. The experiences of getting lost in the Google Cloud Console, almost committing environment variables to Git, and struggling to figure out why a popup wouldn't appear have now become a valuable learning process.

> "It was more complicated than I thought... but I figured it out one step at a time!"

I wrote this article in the hope that junior developers can experience fewer trials and errors when implementing Google login. I will honestly share the actual code implemented in a **Svelte/SvelteKit** environment, along with the choices I made and the problems I faced.

## 1. Trial and Error 1 - Confusion in Google Cloud Console Settings

The first step I found when searching for "Google login implementation" was to create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the **Google Cloud Console**. However, there were more steps than I expected.

### Mistake 1: Roughly setting up the OAuth consent screen

I made a mistake in selecting between "Internal" and "External" on the OAuth consent screen. For a personal project or public service, you must select **"External"**.

### Mistake 2: Incorrectly setting the Redirect URI

The biggest problem was setting the **Authorized redirect URIs**. It took me hours of trial and error to realize that the port number, and even a single slash, must match exactly to avoid a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error.

Initial setup:
```
http://localhost:3000/callback
```

Correct setup:
```
http://localhost:5173          # Vite development server
https://cvfactory.dev          # Production domain
```

### Resolution Process: Systematically reconfiguring

#### OAuth flow selection rationale
Reasons for choosing Authorization Code Flow with PKCE:
- **SPA Security**: Prevents client secret exposure
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Consistent authentication flow with native apps
- **Refresh Tokens**: Enables long-term authentication

![Google OAuth Flow](../assets/images/05/google-oauth-flow.svg)

> **Developer Anecdote**
> "The biggest barrier when implementing OAuth in international startup environments was integration with overseas services. Official documentation with limited localization was the main challenge."

After hours of struggling, I found the correct setup method.

#### Step 1: Create a project and enable the API
- Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the 'Google Identity Services API'.

#### Step 2: Configure the OAuth consent screen
```yaml
Application name: CV Factory
User support email: your-email@gmail.com
Authorized domains: cvfactory.dev (for production)
```

#### Step 3: Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
```yaml
Application type: Web application
Name: Web Client
Authorized JavaScript origins:
  - http://localhost:5173
  - https://cvfactory.dev
Authorized redirect URIs:
  - http://localhost:5173
  - https://cvfactory.dev
```

Once the setup is complete, you will get a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. **Important**: The Client Secret is not used in the frontend.

## 2. Trial and Error 2 - Environment Variables and Security Mistakes

### A dangerous moment: Client Secret in the frontend?
At first, I thought I had to use both the Client ID and the Client Secret in the frontend code.
```javascript
// ❌ Code you should never write
const GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = "GOCSPX-very-secret-key"; // Dangerous!
```

Fortunately, before committing, I realized that the Client Secret is not needed in the frontend when using **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**.

### Mistake 1: Almost committing the .env file to Git
I created a `.env` file for environment variables and habitually ran `git add .`, but quickly canceled with `git reset HEAD .env`. Files containing sensitive information, like `.env.local`, must be added to `.gitignore`.

### Mistake 2: Missing the `VITE_` prefix in Vite
In Vite, environment variables that are accessible on the client side must be prefixed with `VITE_`. I didn't know this, so `import.meta.env.GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` was always `undefined`.

#### Correct environment variable setup and usage
```bash
# .env.local (must be in .gitignore)
VITE_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=123456789-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

```typescript
// lib/google-auth.ts
const CLIENT_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID;

// Error handling for missing environment variables
if (!CLIENT_ID) {
  throw new Error("VITE_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID is not set.");
}
```

## 3. Trial and Error 3 - Code Implementation and Debugging Hell

### Mistake 1: Google API script loading timing
In SvelteKit, the component can be mounted before the script is loaded, so **dynamically loading the script** is a more stable method.
```typescript
// ✅ Dynamic script loading
private loadGoogleIdentityScript(): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (window.google?.accounts) {
      resolve();
      return;
    }
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client';
    script.onload = () => resolve();
    script.onerror = () => reject(new Error('Failed to load Google Identity Services.'));
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  });
}
```

### Mistake 2: Old API vs. New API
I initially tried to use `gapi.auth2`, but it was **deprecated**. Since 2023, you should use **Google Identity Services**.

### Mistake 3: "What is a token? How do I get user information?"
I didn't understand the OAuth flow properly and didn't know what to do after receiving the token. I later learned that I had to **call the user info API with the access token**.
```typescript
// ✅ Get user information with a token
// Test directly in editor: https://playground.example.com?code=...
callback: async (response: any) => {
  if (response.error) {
    reject(new Error("Google login failed."));
    return;
  }
  try {
    const userInfoResponse = await fetch(
      `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo?access_token=${response.access_token}`
    );
    if (!userInfoResponse.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch user information.");
    }
    const userInfo = await userInfoResponse.json();
    resolve(userInfo);
  } catch (error) {
    reject(new Error("Failed to fetch user information."));
  }
};
```
### Mistake 4: Poor error handling
Initially, I only handled all errors with `console.error`. However, I improved it to provide appropriate messages for different situations such as **popup blocked**, **popup closed**, and **network error**.
```typescript
// ✅ Enhanced error handling system
error_callback: (error: any) => {
  const errorMap = {
    'popup_closed': 'Login canceled',
    'popup_blocked': 'Popup blocked. Please check browser settings',
    'access_denied': 'Access denied',
    'invalid_request': 'Invalid request',
    'unauthorized_client': 'Unauthorized client',
    'token_expired': 'Token expired',
    'network_error': 'Network connection issue occurred'
  };

  const errorMessage = errorMap[error.type] ||
                      `Unknown error: ${error.message}`;

  // Error logging and monitoring
  console.error(`[Google Auth Error] ${error.type}: ${error.message}`);
  sendToMonitoring(error);

  reject(new Error(errorMessage));
};
```

## 4. Trial and Error 4 - UI/UX and State Management Challenges

### Mistake 1: Managing state only within the component
At first, I tried to manage all state within the component, but this caused problems where other components couldn't know the login state.

### Solution: Global state management with Svelte Stores
I used a **Svelte Store** to manage global state (login status, user information, loading status) that needs to be shared across multiple components.
```typescript
// lib/stores/auth.ts
import { writable } from "svelte/store";

function createAuthStore() {
  const { subscribe, set, update } = writable({
    isLoggedIn: false,
    user: null,
    isLoading: false,
    error: null,
  });

  return {
    subscribe,
    async login() {
      /* ... */
    },
    async logout() {
      /* ... */
    },
    async checkAuthStatus() {
      /* Check localStorage on page load */
    },
  };
}

export const authStore = createAuthStore();
```

### Completed GoogleAuthButton Component Example
I configured the component to handle various states (loading, error, logged in).
```html
<!-- lib/components/GoogleAuthButton.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { authStore } from '../stores/auth.js';
  // ... (omitted) ...
</script>

<div class="auth-container">
  {#if $authStore.isLoggedIn && $authStore.user}
    <!-- Logged in state: profile image, name, dropdown menu -->
  {:else}
    <!-- Logged out state: Google login button -->
    <button class="login-button" on:click={() => authStore.login()} disabled={$authStore.isLoading}>
      {#if $authStore.isLoading}
        <div class="spinner"></div>
        <span>Logging in...</span>
      {:else}
        <span>Login with Google</span>
      {/if}
    </button>
  {/if}

  {#if $authStore.error}
    <div class="error-message">{$authStore.error}</div>
  {/if}
</div>

<style>
  .spinner {
    border: 2px solid #f3f3f3;
    border-top: 2px solid #3c4043;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 16px;
    height: 16px;
    animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
  }
  @keyframes spin { 0% { transform: rotate(0deg); } 100% { transform: rotate(360deg); } }
</style>
```

## 5. Trial and Error 5 - Deployment and Domain Configuration Issues

### Performance Optimization Techniques
- ✅ **Token Caching**: Store tokens in local storage to reduce API calls
- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Load Google
