## Introduction

While adding features like a **hamburger menu, OAuth login, and per-user settings** to a side project, I started to feel the limits of plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (hereafter *vanilla JS*). As stateful widgets multiplied, so did the DOM spaghetti. That raised the million-dollar question:

> "Should I adopt Svelte (or SvelteKit), or keep pushing with vanilla JS?"

Based on a lengthy internal discussion (see `7.1.md`), this post distills a **hands-on checklist** for balancing framework benefits against resource constraints.

---

### 1. When do you actually need a framework?

| Requirement | Pain with vanilla JS | Svelte (Kit) advantage |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Shared state across multiple components | Long `querySelector` chains & ad-hoc event buses | `$:` reactivity, Stores for global state |
| Client-side routing (SPA feel) | Must hand-roll History API logic | File-based routing built-in |
| SEO + SSR | Django template handles SSR, but JS widgets ship as empty `<div>` | SvelteKit server-side render & prerender |
| Bundle optimization | Manual Webpack/Vite tuning | Vite-powered build & code splitting by default |
| Team & feature growth | No conventions â†’ onboarding cost â†‘ | Component/file conventions baked in |

> **TL;DR** â€” The more shared state, reusable components, and SEO you need, the faster SvelteKit pays for itself.

### 2. Risks of staying vanilla

1. **DOM spaghetti** â€” tracking who mutates the DOM becomes a nightmare.
2. **State desync bugs** â€” login/logout, dark-mode toggles, etc. easily drift.
3. **Testing overhead** â€” E2E tests require verbose DOM selectors.
4. **Bundle fatigue** â€” every new page demands manual caching & split-chunk tweaks.

### 3. Option comparison

  subgraph "ðŸ‘Ÿ Vanilla JS"
    A1[HTML Template] -->|DOM manip| A2[script.js]
  end
  subgraph "ðŸ§© Svelte Components"
    B1[Django Template] --> B2[<script src="build.js">]
    B2 --> B3[Svelte Widget]
  end
  subgraph "ðŸš€ SvelteKit + API"
    C1[SvelteKit SSR] -->|REST| C2[Django API]
  end
```

| Model | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| **Vanilla JS** | No Node runtime â†’ low memory | Must implement state & routing yourself |
| **Svelte Components** | Drop-in interactive widgets | Full page reload between Django views |
| **SvelteKit** | SPA feel **and** SSR/SEO | Extra Node server to operate |

---

### 4. A Python-first, resource-minimal architecture

> Assumptions: SEO/GEO only matters for the landing page, you're on Northflank's free tier, and you prefer Python-centric ops.

1. **Backend** â€” Django (templates + REST API)
2. **Frontend**
   * Landing page: Django template with SEO meta tags
   * Dashboard & settings: Svelte bundle served as static assets
3. **Build pipeline (multi-stage Docker)**
   ```bash
   FROM node:20 AS client-build
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY frontend/ .
   RUN npm ci ; npm run build

   FROM python:3.11-slim AS runtime
   WORKDIR /srv
   COPY --from=client-build /app/build/ /srv/static/
   COPY requirements.txt . ; pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   COPY . /srv
   CMD gunicorn config.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
   ```
   â†’ The **runtime image** ships with *no* Node binary, trimming RAM usage.

### 5. Cloudflare Worker BFF & Edge Caching

> Need to hide API keys and off-load traffic without burning your free Northflank quota? Put a tiny **Cloudflare Worker** in front of the API.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser
  participant CF as Cloudflare
  participant Worker
  participant Django
  participant External as External API

  Browser->>CF: GET /api/orders
  CF-->>Worker: Route /api/*
  Worker->>External: GET /v1/orders (add API-KEY)
  External-->>Worker: JSON payload
  Worker-->>CF: 60 s edge-cached response
  CF-->>Browser: JSON + CORS headers
  Browser->>Django: (separate) GET /
  Django-->>Browser: SEO-ready HTML
```

Key points:

* **Security** â€” API keys live in Worker secrets; never reach the browser.
* **Speed** â€” `cf: { cacheTtl: 60 }` caches JSON at 300+ global edges.
* **Cost** â€” Workers Free plan â†’ 2.5 M requests/mo at zero dollars.

```js
// cf-worker.js (snippet)
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    if (request.method === 'OPTIONS') {
      return new Response(null, { status: 204, headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', ... } });
    }

    const api = new URL(env.UPSTREAM_URL);
    api.pathname = '/v1/orders';
    api.search = new URL(request.url).search;

    const upstream = await fetch(api, {
      headers: { 'X-API-KEY': env.API_KEY },
      cf: { cacheTtl: 60, cacheEverything: true }
    });

    const res = new Response(upstream.body, upstream);
    res.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    return res;
  }
};
```

### 6. CI/CD & Deployment Flow

1. **Local commit**
   ```bash
   git add . ; git commit -m "feat: landing SEO + CF worker" ; git push origin develop
   ```
2. **Northflank pipeline**
   * Auto-detects push, builds multi-stage Dockerfile, deploys container.
3. **Optional manual deploy**
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:latest .
   docker push myrepo/myapp:latest ; nf deploy myapp
   ```
4. **Cloudflare Worker**
   ```bash
   wrangler publish --env production
   ```

### 7. Resource-saving levers

| Lever | Why it helps |
|-------|--------------|
| Drop Node at runtime | ~100 MB RAM saved; fewer CVEs to watch |
| Edge cache JSON & static assets | Django handles fewer requests; lower CPU quota |
| LocMemCache â†’ Redis add-on (later) | Start cheap, scale only when needed |
| Multi-stage Docker | Final image < 200 MB, faster cold start |

---

### 8. Future roadmap

* **UI complexity â†‘** â†’ Switch to `SvelteKit adapter-static`, still no Node server.
* **Real-time feed** â†’ Add `Django Channels + Redis` or Server-Sent Events.
* **i18n & theming** â†’ Use Svelte stores or `htmx` partial swaps.
* **Traffic spikes** â†’ Scale Northflank replicas + tune Cloudflare cache TTL.

---

### 9. Decision checklist (quick recap)

- [ ] Will you exceed ~10 distinct pages?
- [ ] Do at least two places need shared global state (auth, theme, notifications)?
- [ ] Are most pages SEO-critical, or only the landing page?
- [ ] Can you afford to run and monitor an extra Node server?
- [ ] Does someone on the team already know a JS framework?

If you answer **yes** to **3 or more**, reach for SvelteKit. Otherwise, *vanilla JS + selective Svelte widgets* will likely suffice.

---

## Conclusion

Adopting a framework is **insurance against future tech debt**. Vanilla JS accelerates early momentum, but as features, team size, and SEO requirements grow, **maintenance cost skyrockets**.

Weigh today's needs against tomorrow's complexity to choose the **right moment** to migrate. A phased pathâ€”*Svelte widgets â†’ SvelteKit*â€”remains totally valid.

> ðŸ’¡ Tooling is secondary to the **value you ship** and your **team's productivity**. Pick what lets you move fastest *today* without boxing you in *tomorrow*.
