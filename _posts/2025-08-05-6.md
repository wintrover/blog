## 🎯 Project Overview

I've been tasked with developing a facial recognition-based user authentication system for the company platform, working independently on this critical project. This goes beyond simple feature development, encompassing real-time processing, multi-environment adaptation, and web-based implementation across various technical challenges.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Technology Development & Performance Optimization (July 30)

### Deepface + MediaPipe Hybrid Architecture Implementation

I developed a real-time facial recognition prototype based on Deepface's ArcFace model. However, initial testing revealed significant recognition rate drops in various environments (lighting, angles, glasses, etc.).

**Solution**: Applied MediaPipe 3D landmark technology to dramatically improve recognition rates across diverse conditions.

### Performance Optimization Tasks

- **Processing Speed**: Enhanced to 5.5 FPS
- **Memory Management**: Resolved memory leaks that occurred during technology integration
- **Real-time Processing**: Implemented real-time face detection based on webcam streaming

## 🏗️ Phase 2: KYC System Architecture Design & Requirements Analysis (July 31 - August 1)

### Requirements Gathering & System Design

Through development process reporting, I gathered specific requirements for the KYC procedure:

- **User Guidance**: Real-time guidance like "Look left, look right"
- **Data Storage**: Multi-frame capture and video storage capabilities
- **Precision Analysis**: Similarity analysis for specific facial regions (eyes, nose, mouth) in addition to full face

### Architecture Transition

Shifted from desktop environment to web browser-based webcam system implementation.

### Technical Review & Collaboration Environment Setup

- **Patent Analysis**: Compared ETRI and Apple patents to evaluate technical utility
- **Collaboration Environment**: Established Docker and GitHub-based development environment sharing
- **Version Control**: Developed branching strategies for efficient collaboration

## 🌐 Phase 3: Web-based System Implementation & Technical Challenge Resolution (August 4-5)

### Backend Technology Stack Migration

To enable webcam functionality in web environment, migrated backend from Python to Express.js.

**Key Changes**:
- Python Flask → Node.js Express.js migration
- WebSocket implementation for real-time communication
- RESTful API design

### MediaPipe Web Integration Problem Resolution

Encountered several technical issues during MediaPipe web integration:

#### 3.1 CSP (Content Security Policy) Conflicts
```javascript
// Problem: CDN resources blocked by CSP
// Solution: Updated helmet middleware configuration
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net"],
      workerSrc: ["'self'", "blob:"]
    }
  }
}));
```

#### 3.2 File Loading Timing Issues
- Resolved WASM file loading delays
- Implemented Promise-based initialization for async loading
- Optimized module dependency management

#### 3.3 Landmark Data Processing Errors
```javascript
// Problem: Landmark coordinates returned as normalized values
// Solution: Added logic for pixel coordinate conversion
drawLandmarkPoints() {
  this.ctx.arc(
    landmark.x * this.canvas.width, 
    landmark.y * this.canvas.height, 
    this.landmarkStyle.radius, 
    0, 
    2 * Math.PI
  );
}
```

## 🔧 Phase 4: Debugging & Performance Optimization

### Key Issues & Resolution Process

#### 4.1 Yaw Angle Measurement Error
**Problem**: Yaw angle measured abnormally high (85 degrees) when facing forward

**Root Cause**: Default values (0,0) from `generateDummyLandmarks` function included in face width calculation

**Solution**: Modified `calculateAngles` function to skip dummy landmarks
```javascript
// Exclude dummy landmarks during face width calculation
const validLandmarks = landmarks.filter(landmark => 
  landmark.x !== 0 || landmark.y !== 0
);
const faceWidth = Math.max(...validLandmarks.map(l => l.x)) - 
                  Math.min(...validLandmarks.map(l => l.x));
```

#### 4.2 Landmark Rendering Performance Issues
**Problem**: Performance degradation when rendering 478 landmark points in real-time

**Solutions**: 
- Removed 95% of unnecessary console logs
- Canvas rendering optimization
- Implemented smooth animations using requestAnimationFrame

#### 4.3 Server Connection Issues
**Problem**: `FaceRecognitionClient`'s `testServerConnection` method causing infinite loops

**Solution**: Added retry limits (20 attempts, ~2 seconds) and proper error handling for initialization failures

## 📊 Current Status & Remaining Tasks

### ✅ Completed Features
- Deepface + MediaPipe hybrid facial recognition system
- Web-based webcam integration
- Real-time landmark rendering (478 points)
- Basic KYC workflow implementation
- Performance optimization (5.5 FPS)

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Yaw Angle Measurement Error**: Currently debugging, need algorithm improvement for accurate angle measurement
- **Quality Assessment System**: Completing real-time quality evaluation functionality when server connected
- **User Interface**: Improving intuitive UI/UX for end users

### 🎯 Next Phase Plans
1. **Yaw Angle Measurement Accuracy Enhancement**
2. **Multi-face Processing Feature Addition**
3. **Liveness Detection Implementation for Security Enhancement**
4. **Mobile Environment Support**
5. **Production Server Deployment**

## 💡 Key Learnings
